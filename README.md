# node-mcu-esp8266-accelerometer-adxl345-with-mqtt
this project is connect accelerometer adxl 345 with node mcu esp8266 and sent data to cloud using mqtt

The hardware and software specifications needed to be able to make a monitoring system with accelerometer sensors based on wireless sensor networks with MQTT are as follows:
Hardware needed:
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Accelerometer ADXL 345 sensor
- 1 Wi-Fi Modem unit
- Power Supplay (bank power / battery circuit)
Software needed:
- Arduino IDE 1.6.12
- .js node
- PHPmyadmin
- Xampp
- Coolterm
- Browser
- MQTT box / MQTT dashboard

1. Connect the ESP8266 NodeMCU with the ADXL 345 accelerometer sensor by attaching a jumper cable between NodeMCU pin D2 to the SDI accelerometer pin sensor and pin D1 to SDA pin on the sensor.
2. Connect the GND pin on the MCU node with the GND pin on the accelerometer sensor.
3. Connect the power supplay pin on ESP8266 NodeMCU 3V3 pin with VCC pin on ADXL 345 accelerometer sensor
4. Connect the USB port to power supply 5V.
